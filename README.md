# Unweighted gpa-calculator
a gpa calculator written in python 
Calculates unweighted GPA
This project is a Python-based GPA Calculator that computes unweighted GPAs using a standard 10-point grading scale.
It allows users to input multiple classes and automatically calculates an accurate GPA according to typical NC high school standards.
Supports unweighted GPA calculation


Based on a 10-point scale (no differentiation between A, A-, or A+).

Easy-to-follow command-line interface, no external libraries required.

Clean, ethical code written entirely from scratch.
This program was coded independently without the use of AI-generated code.
All logic, structure, and debugging were done manually to ensure full understanding and transparency.
Version control (Git commits) documents the entire development process.
Late October 2025: Started project planning and setup (GitHub repo, environment).

November 2025 (Week 1):

Coded the unweighted GPA calculator using a 10-point scale.

Tested accuracy with multiple grade/class type combinations.

Finalized and documented the project.
